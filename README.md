InformN/Acast Cisco Paging tool

Meant for use on FreePBX Systems that dont support SingleWire Software.

For this to work
- CGI must be working
- You have the CUCM default ringers avaliable on your provisioning server (prefferably http support)

Note: As of v1.0.2, SIP has not been tested. Only SCCP. We cannot guarantee it will work.


To be added
- Image alerts (will require special configuration and may not work with 79xx)
- Application instead of a batch
- Web tool
